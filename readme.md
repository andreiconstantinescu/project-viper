# Project viper.

This is a seed for `React` projects that uses most of the bleeding edge tools and techniques.
The seed follows the concept of tree shaking with the help of webpack2 and babel6.

## Prerequisites.

I recommend using `yarn` but the classic `npm` will do just fine.

## How to use.

clone the project somewhere.
```
> git clone <this_project>
```

move to the previously cloned location and install dependencies.
```
> cd project-viper
> yarn
```

start the dev server
```
> yarn start
```

open `localhost:3000` in your browser.

start creating.

â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ WelcomeNote
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ stats.json
â”œâ”€â”€ webpack.config.dev.js
â”œâ”€â”€ webpack.config.prod.js
â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock
```
Each component can have it's own `.css` file that is required in the component's exported `.js` file. Because of using `css modules` the style is scoped in the component and there are no global selectors exposed.

This project uses tachyons, being the only global classes available throughout the project. For overriding variables, at the moment, just rewrite them in the `.css` file for each component.

Contents of the `assets` folder are linked on dev env and optimised when building for production.

# Run for production.

```
> yarn run build
```

The `static` folder will appear in the project root having the following structure.

```
static
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ images
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ background.png
â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ tachyons.css
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ js
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
â””â”€â”€ vendor.bundle.js
```
